            <p>
                These are accordion sets. To create a stack/group of accordions, you must copy the entire accordion
                and paste directly below. Pressing 'Enter/Return' will not create another accordion. You can use the single
                and double sets to create odd and even number of accordion sets respectively.
            </p>
