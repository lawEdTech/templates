# Templates

Queen's University Faculty of Law HTML and CSS Templates.
These are reusable templates for use in the D2L Brightspace HTML Editor. They are intended for Instructional Designers and Education Developers use to format and deliver online course content.

### Technologies Used

- Bootstrap CSS CDN v5.3.3
- Font Awesome CDN for icons
- HTML5
- Google Fonts

### Important Notes

While working in the d2l brightspace editor, only HTML is accepted. Therefore any template or editable component must be in HTML only. Brightspace HTML Editor cannot read Javascript, and any javascript component or javascript use inside of HTML will not be editable in the Brightspace HTML Editor environment. The HTML files are purposefully repetitive to work around this problem.
