# templates
Queen's University Faculty of Law HTML and CSS Tempates

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
While working in the d2l brightspace editor, only HTML is accepted. Therefore any template or editable component must be in html only. Creating web components by extending HTML in Javascript will not produce an editable template in brightspace, rendering it useless.

Due to this, the templates are divided into HTML files for each group of components. The architecture of the templates folder is similar to modules in python. 

DEPENDENCIES
- Bootstrap cdn v5.3.3 (js script)
- styles.css file for customization
- font awesome cdn for icons (js script)
